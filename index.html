		What is Probabilistic Programming?
	      </div>
	      <div>
		Probabilistic programming (PP) has recently emerged as a promising approach
		for helping software developers to easily implement Bayesian inference
		problems and automate efficient execution of inference tasks. These
		systems automate various parts of common inference tasks and support
		many approximate inference algorithms from machine learning and
		statistics, including deterministic variational inference and
		randomized MCMC simulation.

		A probabilistic programming system (PP system) typically consists of a
		language, a compiler, and inference procedures. A developer writes a
		program in a probabilistic programming language, which extends a
		standard programming language by adding con- structs for (1) random
		choice, such as sampling from common distributions, (2) conditioning
		on data, such as observation statements, and (3) probabilistic
		queries, such as obtaining a posterior distribution or an expected
		value of a program variable. Next, a PP system compiles the
		probabilistic program to an efficient inference procedure, by adapting
		well-known inference algorithms. Lastly, developers run the compiled
		program on a set of data points to compute the query result.

		What is ProbFuzz?
	      </div>
	      <div >
		ProbFuzz is a novel approach and system for systematically testing
		PP systems. The inputs to ProbFuzz are:
		(1) a general specification of the distributions that ProbFuzz supports,
		(2) the number of programs to generate, and
		(3) a template of a general probabilistic programming language.
		
		ProbFuzz outputs a set of programs that are likely bug-revealing
		in the PP systems. ProbFuzz has three main components:

		• Generator completes holes in a template to produce (1) a
		probabilistic program in an intermediate language and (2) accompanying
		data necessary to run probabilistic inference. Template completion is
		a form of fuzzing: Generator produces many programs, with different
		concrete distributions, distribution parameter values, and data
		values. To generate programs that are more likely to identify
		non-trivial bugs, Generator incorporates domain-specific information,
		e.g., legal connections among distributions, ranges of their
		parameters, and data properties.
		
		• Translator converts the intermediate probabilistic program to a
		specific API or language of a PP system under test, and selects
		system-supported inference algorithms. We implemented three versions
		of Translator, for Edward, Pyro, and Stan.
		
		• Program Checker runs generated programs and determines whether
		the outputs indicate likely bugs in the PP system on which the
		programs were run. Program Checker produces a set of likely
		bug-revealing programs for developers to inspect, and supports
		checks for standard problems (like crashes or NaN errors in the
		output) and accuracy of inference results.

		We characterized the kinds of bugs that are common in existing
		open-source systems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first
		systematic study of bugs in PP systems. We studied three systems:
		Edward, Pyro, and Stan.  They are written in multiple programming
		languages, are hosted on GitHub, have been adopted by both industry
		and researchers, are actively developed, and implement many language
		features and inference algorithms that are common to most PP
		systems. In total, we categorized 118 of 856 commits about bugs as
		being PP systems-related.
